# CalOps Status Update - June 30, 2025

## Current Branch Status

### DEVL Branch Status
**Current State**: ✅ Running locally without errors
**Recent Updates**:
- ✅ Added venue filtering by Division and City (CALOPS-24)
- ✅ Changed tabs from "Validated/Invalid Geo" to "Approved/Not Approved"
- ✅ Updated filtering to use isApproved field
- ✅ Added compact row density for venues table
- ✅ Component-based architecture maintained (VenuesPageContainer)
- ✅ Created VenueEditDialog component with full functionality
- ✅ Added isActive/isApproved toggle switches in edit dialog
- ✅ Implemented geo hierarchy selection (manual and nearest city modes)
- ✅ Fixed API client usage in useVenues hook

**Pending Work**:
- ❌ Import from BTC functionality (exists in TEST but not DEVL)

### TEST Branch Status  
**Current State**: ❌ Deployment has errors
**Issues**:
1. **Firebase Error**: `Error initializing Firebase: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input`
   - Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_JSON` environment variable in Vercel
   
2. **API 404 Errors**: All API calls failing
   - `/api/venues-debug` → 404
   - `/api/geo-hierarchy` → 404  
   - `/api/venues` → 404
   - Backend API not configured/deployed for TEST environment

**Features in TEST**:
- ✅ Full inline venue management implementation
- ✅ Complete edit venue dialog with all features
- ✅ Import from BTC functionality
- ✅ Geo hierarchy selection in edit modal
- ✅ isActive/isApproved switches

## Key Differences Between Branches

### Architecture
- **DEVL**: Component-based (VenuesPageContainer → VenuesPage → VenueTable)
- **TEST**: Inline implementation (all logic in page.js file)

### Features
| Feature | DEVL | TEST |
|---------|------|------|
| Division/City Filtering | ✅ | ✅ |
| Approved/Not Approved Tabs | ✅ | ✅ |
| Compact Row Display | ✅ | ✅ |
| Full Edit Dialog | ✅ | ✅ |
| isActive/isApproved Switches | ✅ | ✅ |
| Import from BTC | ❌ | ✅ |
| Geo Hierarchy Selection | ✅ | ✅ |

## To Fix TEST Deployment

1. **Add Environment Variables to Vercel**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_JSON=<base64 encoded firebase config>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BE_URL=<backend API URL>
   ```

2. **Configure Backend API**:
   - Deploy backend API for TEST environment
   - Update NEXT_PUBLIC_BE_URL to point to TEST backend

## To Complete DEVL Implementation

1. **Add Import Functionality** (optional):
   - Create ImportVenuesDialog component
   - Add import from BTC feature
   - This is the only remaining feature in TEST that's not in DEVL

## Current JIRA Ticket
