Within 5 months, it already had 250 members, and the numbers are growing weekly! While there are many facets to the Argentine Tango—the music and the culture being among the most prominent—it is the dance that brings most of us together.<br />\nThe Tango is a social and participant’s dance and is for everyone to learn and enjoy, regardless of dance background!</p>\n<p>Our membership has people from all walks of life, and has probably 20 or more countries represented! !</p>\n<h2><strong>What Do We Do?</strong></h2>\n<p>We are not just a paper organization! Our numerous activities fall into two broad categories:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Planning Tango events</strong></p>\n<p>Weekly Wednesday evening Tango dances at 16 Bow St, Union Sq, Somerville open to all, with a 1-hour lesson at the beginning<br />\nWeekend Tango seminars several times a year with the best Tango teachers in the world (usually from Argentina), such as the one with the renowned Pablo Veron, Fernanda Ghi and Guillermo Merlo, Daniela Arcuri, Hector Falcon, to name a few.<br />\nMilongas (Tango dance socials), some with live music<br />\nSpecial and unusual Tango events such as outdoor “Tango by Moonlight” nights in summer<br />\nOur Annual Boston Tango Festival in June</p>\n<p><strong>2.

          "description": "<h2><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Tango Society of Boston was incorporated in June 1997 as a Massachusetts non-profit organization dedicated to the support and growth of the Argentine Tango. Within 5 months, it already had 250 members, and the numbers are growing weekly! While there are many facets to the Argentine Tango—the music and the culture being among the most prominent—it is the dance that brings most of us together.<br />\nThe Tango is a social and participant’s dance and is for everyone to learn and enjoy, regardless of dance background!</p>\n<p>Our membership has people from all walks of life, and has probably 20 or more countries represented! !</p>\n<h2><strong>What Do We Do?</strong></h2>\n<p>We are not just a paper organization! Our numerous activities fall into two broad categories:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Planning Tango events</strong></p>\n<p>Weekly Wednesday evening Tango dances at 16 Bow St, Union Sq, Somerville open to all, with a 1-hour lesson at the beginning<br />\nWeekend Tango seminars several times a year with the best Tango teachers in the world (usually from Argentina), such as the one with the renowned Pablo Veron, Fernanda Ghi and Guillermo Merlo, Daniela Arcuri, Hector Falcon, to name a few.<br />\nMilongas (Tango dance socials), some with live music<br />\nSpecial and unusual Tango events such as outdoor “Tango by Moonlight” nights in summer<br />\nOur Annual Boston Tango Festival in June</p>\n<p><strong>2. Supporting the growth of the Tango community</strong></p>\n<p>We sponsor TangoLine™, a 24-hour Tango hotline publicizing events for all Tango organizers in the Boston area&#8211;<br />\ntry it at 617-699-OCHO (-6246)<br />\nSupport local Tango organizers, musicians, etc., through our events, affiliations, and publicity and information channels<br />\nOutreach efforts via newspaper, radio and TV publicity<br />\nJoint events with other local and regional art and cultural institutions, both commercial and non-profit (e.g., Museum of Fine Arts, First Night Boston, movie houses showing Tango-related films, Tango festivals, etc.)</p>",

          "description": "<h2><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Tango Society of Boston was incorporated in June 1997 as a Massachusetts non-profit organization dedicated to the support and growth of the Argentine Tango. Within 5 months, it already had 250 members, and the numbers are growing weekly! While there are many facets to the Argentine Tango—the music and the culture being among the most prominent—it is the dance that brings most of us together.<br />\nThe Tango is a social and participant’s dance and is for everyone to learn and enjoy, regardless of dance background!</p>\n<p>Our membership has people from all walks of life, and has probably 20 or more countries represented! !</p>\n<h2><strong>What Do We Do?</strong></h2>\n<p>We are not just a paper organization! Our numerous activities fall into two broad categories:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Planning Tango events</strong></p>\n<p>Weekly Wednesday evening Tango dances at 16 Bow St, Union Sq, Somerville open to all, with a 1-hour lesson at the beginning<br />\nWeekend Tango seminars several times a year with the best Tango teachers in the world (usually from Argentina), such as the one with the renowned Pablo Veron, Fernanda Ghi and Guillermo Merlo, Daniela Arcuri, Hector Falcon, to name a few.<br />\nMilongas (Tango dance socials), some with live music<br />\nSpecial and unusual Tango events such as outdoor “Tango by Moonlight” nights in summer<br />\nOur Annual Boston Tango Festival in June</p>\n<p><strong>2. Supporting the growth of the Tango community</strong></p>\n<p>We sponsor TangoLine™, a 24-hour Tango hotline publicizing events for all Tango organizers in the Boston area&#8211;<br />\ntry it at 617-699-OCHO (-6246)<br />\nSupport local Tango organizers, musicians, etc., through our events, affiliations, and publicity and information channels<br />\nOutreach efforts via newspaper, radio and TV publicity<br />\nJoint events with other local and regional art and cultural institutions, both commercial and non-profit (e.g., Museum of Fine Arts, First Night Boston, movie houses showing Tango-related films, Tango festivals, etc.)</p>",
