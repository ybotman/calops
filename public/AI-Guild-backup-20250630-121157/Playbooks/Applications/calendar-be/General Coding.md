# Local Development Environment & Coding Guidelines

## Must meet or exceed the Success Critrea
found in the .md '/AI-Guild/SuccessCriteria.md'

## Always-Running Services and Ports

The following backend and service applications will always be running during development:

- **Backend:** `localhost:3010`
- **Tango Tiempo:** `localhost:3001`
- **Harmony Junction:** `localhost:3002`
- **CalOps:** `localhost:3003`

Please keep these services running as you code.

## Refreshing & Resetting

When you need to update data, refresh the terminal with `npm run` and reset the application as needed.

## Port Conflicts

If you (via the Lifecycle) need to do a build or run in development mode and encounter a port conflict, you must use a different port.

For all your npm run build, and npm run dev you must use ports greater the 3019
so npm run dev -- -p 3020, to npm run dev -- -p 3030) are for you.

- **Backend:** `localhost:3020`
- **Tango Tiempo:** `localhost:3021`
- **Harmony Junction:** `localhost:3022`
- **CalOps:** `localhost:3023`

## Commit & Merge Requirements

- **Before committing to git:**  
  You must pass a successful `npm run dev` test (ignoring port conflict issues).

- **Before merging to `DEVL`:**  
  You must pass:
  - A successful `npm run build` and `npm run` test (ignoring port conflict issues).
  - A successful ESLint test.
