## 📝 Description

This merge completes the migration of all API endpoints from local Next.js API routes to direct backend API calls. The application was recently updated to remove the local API layer in favor of directly communicating with the Azure-hosted backend API. This change improves performance, reduces complexity, and eliminates the maintenance burden of proxy API routes.
