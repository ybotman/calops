- **FEATURE_3013**: Remove Password Authentication
- **Issue_1039**: Environment Branch Synchronization

## Description
Removed password-based authentication system to prepare for Firebase role-based access control (RBAC) implementation.

## Changes
### Authentication System
- **Removed**: Password verification API route (`/api/auth`)
- **Removed**: Login page (`/login`)
- **Removed**: Password storage directory (`/public/pwd`)
- **Updated**: Middleware to disable all authentication checks
- **Updated**: AdminLayout to remove logout button

### Documentation
- Created Feature 3013 documentation
- Created Issue 1039 for environment sync tracking

## Build Status
- ✅ ESLint: Config warnings (to be addressed separately)
- ✅ Build: Successful
- ✅ Tests: All pages accessible

## Impact
### User Benefits
- Simplified access during development
- Preparation for more secure Firebase RBAC
- Removed security risk of stored password hashes

### Technical Enhancements
- Cleaner codebase without temporary auth code
- Preserved Firebase infrastructure for future use
- All routes temporarily public (acceptable for dev)

## Next Steps
1. Implement Firebase RBAC
2. Restore route protection with proper authentication
3. Sync TEST and PROD environments with DEVL changes

## Notes
- Feature branch successfully merged and deleted
- No authentication required for any routes
- Firebase libraries retained for future implementation
