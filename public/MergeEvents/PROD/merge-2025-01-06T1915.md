- **Issue_1044**: Organizer Edit Save Not Working in Production (Fixed)

## Description
Fixed critical production issue where organizer edit functionality was failing due to hardcoded TEST backend URL in the API client.

## Changes
### From TEST Branch
- Fixed hardcoded TEST backend URL in `getOrganizers()` function
- Changed to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BE_URL` environment variable
- Ensures consistency across all organizer API methods

## Build Status
- ✅ Build: Successful
- ✅ Tests: Organizer CRUD operations working correctly
- ✅ Fix: Production organizer edit functionality restored

## Impact
### User Benefits
- Organizer edit functionality restored in production
- Consistent behavior across all environments
- No more cross-environment API conflicts

### Technical Enhancements
- Removed hardcoded backend URLs
- All API methods now use environment variables
- Better environment isolation

## Root Cause
The `getOrganizers()` function was hardcoded to use the TEST backend URL while `updateOrganizer()` used the environment variable, causing a mismatch where production would fetch from TEST but try to update on a different backend.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor production for successful organizer updates
2. Verify all environments use correct backend URLs
3. Review other API client files for similar hardcoded URLs

## Notes
- Quick fix for critical production issue
- All branches (DEVL, TEST, PROD) now synchronized with fix
- Consider adding environment URL validation in future
