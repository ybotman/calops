# PMR_UserPageRefactor

## Summary
This PMR outlines a comprehensive refactoring of the Users page in the CalOps administration application. The current implementation is a monolithic component of over 1,300 lines that combines UI rendering, data fetching, state management, and business logic in a single file. This refactoring will separate these concerns, improve code organization, enhance maintainability, and establish patterns for similar refactoring efforts throughout the application.

## Scope
### Inclusions
- Complete restructuring of the UsersPage.js component architecture
- Extraction of presentation components for reusability
- Creation of custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Implementation of improved error handling and data loading patterns
- Optimization of role mapping and filtering logic
- Enhancement of user management operations with proper separation of concerns
- Documentation of the new architecture and component relationships

### Exclusions
- Changes to the backend API endpoints
- Functional changes to user management features
- Authentication system modifications
- Major UI redesign (focus is on code structure, not visual changes)
- Database schema changes

## Motivation
The current Users page implementation exhibits several issues that reduce maintainability and increase development complexity:

1. **Code Size**: At 1,300+ lines, the component is difficult to understand and navigate
2. **Mixed Concerns**: UI rendering, data fetching, and business logic are tightly coupled
3. **Repetitive Code**: Similar UI structures are duplicated across tab panels
4. **Complex State Management**: Managing form state, filtering, and API interactions in one component
5. **Challenging Error Handling**: Error handling scattered throughout the component
6. **Difficult Testing**: The monolithic structure makes unit testing nearly impossible
7. **Debugging Challenges**: Finding issues requires searching through hundreds of lines of code

This refactoring will address these issues by implementing modern React patterns and best practices.

## Changes
- **Frontend:** Split monolithic component into smaller, focused components with separate responsibilities
- **Frontend:** Extract data fetching and state management into custom hooks for better separation of concerns
- **Frontend:** Implement consistent error handling patterns throughout the application
- **Frontend:** Optimize role mapping and processing logic for better performance
- **Frontend:** Add comprehensive documentation for the new architecture

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking existing functionality | Comprehensive test plan with exact feature parity validation |
| Introducing performance regressions | Performance benchmarking before and after changes |
| Extended development time | Phased implementation with incremental improvements |
| Missing edge cases in current implementation | Code review and pair programming during refactoring |
| Increased complexity from splitting code | Clear documentation and consistent patterns across components |

## Rollback Strategy
1. Keep the original UsersPage.js component in a backup file (UsersPage.original.js)
2. Implement feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations
3. Test both implementations side by side before final deployment
4. If issues are found after deployment:
   - Use Git to revert the component changes to the previous version
   - Toggle feature flag to use original implementation
   - Restore any configuration changes made during implementation

## Dependencies
- React 18+ functionality
- MUI components (v5+)
- Existing API client libraries (usersApi, rolesApi)
- Role and user data schemas
- UserEditForm component

# Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

### Goals
Thoroughly analyze the current implementation and plan the component structure for the refactored User page.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Document current component structure and responsibilities | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Identify logical boundaries for component extraction | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Create component hierarchy diagram | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Define interface contracts between components | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Document state management requirements | 2025-05-01 |

### Rollback (if needed)
No changes to production code in this phase. Documentation can be archived if the approach changes.

### Notes
Focus on maintaining all current functionality while establishing clear component boundaries. Document the specific responsibilities of each proposed component.

# Phase 2: Extract Reusable UI Components

### Goals
Extract UI components that can be reused across the application to improve maintainability and reduce duplication.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Extract TabPanel component to shared components | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Create UserTable component with DataGrid integration | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Extract UserSearchBar component | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Create StatusDisplay component for user status indicators | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Extract dialog components (AddUserDialog, EditUserDialog) | 2025-05-01 |

### Rollback (if needed)
1. Remove imports of the new components
2. Revert to using inline component definitions
3. Delete the extracted component files

### Notes
Ensure each extracted component has proper PropTypes, documentation, and basic tests. Keep components focused on presentation concerns only.

# Phase 3: Implement Custom Hooks for Data Management

### Goals
Move business logic and data fetching into custom hooks to improve separation of concerns and testability.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Create useUsers hook for fetching and caching user data | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Implement useRoles hook for role management | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Develop useUserFilter hook for search and filtering | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Extract form logic into useUserForm hook | 2025-05-01 |
| ⏳ Pending | Create useOrganizerActions hook for organizer operations | 2025-05-01 |

### Rollback (if needed)
1. Remove imports of the custom hooks
2. Revert to using inline data fetching and state management
3. Delete the hook files from the codebase

### Notes
Focus on making hooks reusable across the application. Include proper error handling, loading states, and retry logic. Ensure each hook has a clear, focused responsibility.

# Phase 4: Refactor Role Mapping and Processing Logic

### Goals
Improve the complex role mapping and processing logic to enhance performance and readability.

### Tasks

### Rollback (if needed)
1. Revert to original role processing logic in UsersPage.js
2. Remove imports of any utility functions
3. Delete the utility files from the codebase

### Notes
The current role mapping contains extensive debugging code and repeated operations (lines 127-196). This phase will streamline this logic while maintaining the same functionality.

# Phase 5: Rebuild Main Component with New Architecture

### Goals
Reassemble the Users page with the new component structure while maintaining all current functionality.

### Tasks

### Notes
Aim for high test coverage to prevent regressions in future changes. Focus particularly on complex logic like role mapping.

# Phase 7: Performance Optimization

### Goals
Ensure the refactored implementation maintains or improves performance, especially with large user lists.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
