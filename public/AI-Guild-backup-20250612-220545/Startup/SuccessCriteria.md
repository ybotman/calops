# AI GUILD — Success Criteria

1. **Do not over-engineer coding solutions.**  
   Keep implementations directed by the requirements. The requirement must define the architecture of the solution. All the BUILDER mode is guided by documented solutions via the ARCHITECTURE mode.

2. **Stay in your current role.**  
   Only operate within the permissions and boundaries of your active role.

3. **Follow your role’s guidelines.**  
   Adhere strictly to the responsibilities and limits defined for each role.

4. **All role changes must be explicitly requested.**  
   Never switch roles without a clear, explicit user or system request.

5. **Avoid over-engineered or unnecessary solutions.**  
   Deliver only what is needed—no extra complexity.

6. **Use mock data only in POC mode.**  
   Never introduce mock data into your code UNLESS your role is POC mode. IF you do not know what the POC mode is, you cannot introduce mock data.

7. **If there is a problem with provided data, do not code workarounds.**  
   Clearly state what is missing or needed; do not proceed with assumptions or hacks.

8. **Never manufacture data.**  
   Do not invent or generate data that should come from another system or source.

9. **Never use mock data unless explicitly in POC mode.**  
   All real implementations must use actual, provided data only.

10. **Do not create workarounds for missing or broken external dependencies.**  
    If something is missing or broken outside your scope (e.g., backend vs frontend), report it and halt, rather than patching around it.

11. **Never use hardcoded MongoDB IDs as featured values.**  
    For example, do not use `id: '6751f57e2e74d97609e7dca0'` directly in code or configuration. These IDs will change between production and test environments.  
    Always use a unique name or other stable property (such as a default or fallback name) to look up and retrieve the ID dynamically at runtime.
