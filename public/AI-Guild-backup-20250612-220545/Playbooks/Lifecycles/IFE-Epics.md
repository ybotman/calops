# Epic System - Large Effort, Multi-Phase, Multi-Branch Process

> **IFE Epic Document**  
> This document is the single source of truth for all actions, decisions, and status updates related to this Epic.  
> All Guild roles must update their own section below, using their role icon and a datetime stamp.  
> All assignments, findings, and technical notes must be recorded here by the responsible role.  
>  
> Epics are always **phased** and **heavily documented**.  
> Epics may include:  
> - Large refactors (even if functionally equivalent)  
> - Software design changes  
> - Plugin or dependency swaps  
> - Cross-cutting context or folder structure redesigns  
> - Any multi-file, multi-phase, or architectural effort  
>  
> **Every Epic must include architecture diagrams, graphical summaries, or annotated visuals** to ensure broad understanding and continuity across Guild handoffs or "reboots."

## Purpose

Epic documents define **large, multi-phase efforts** that drive major platform changes: migrations, retirements, data model shifts, and architectural refactors.  
By definition, an Epic is broken into multiple phases, each with its own branch, work effort, and commit cycle.  
**At any time, work is focused on a single phase branch of the larger Epic.**  
Each phase must be independently completed, reviewed, and merged before the next phase begins.  
**The phased approach ensures broad understanding and continuity, even if the Guild team changes or the project is rebooted.**

---

## Folder Structure

Each Epic lives in its own folder.

| Path                                               | Contents                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ` /public/IFE-Tracking/Epics/Current/Epic_<topic>/`   | Active Epic and all related documentation     |
| ` /public/IFE-Tracking/Epics/Completed/Epic_<topic>/` | Completed Epic and all supporting docs, archived |

Inside each Epic folder are documents. Build only the documents you deem necessary based on the scope:

- `Epic_<topic>.md` ‚Üí Main document  
- Additional supporting files (optional):  
  - `Epic_<topic>_Communication.md`  
  - `Epic_<topic>_Summary.md`  
  - `Epic_<topic>_Approach.md`  
  - `Epic_<topic>_API_Changes.md`  
  - `Epic_<topic>_UI_Changes.md`  

---

## Required Structure for `Epic_<topic>.md`

Each Epic must follow this template:

---

# Epic_<topic>

> **Guidance:**  
> Each Guild role must update its own section below, using its icon and a datetime stamp.  
> The only mandatory roles are:  
> - üóÇÔ∏è **KANBAN**: Tracks what must be done, who is assigned, and current status.  
> - üß≠ **SCOUT**: Records research, discoveries, and risks.  
> - üõ†Ô∏è **BUILDER / PATCH / TINKER**: Notes implementation details, blockers, and technical choices.  
>  
> All updates, decisions, and recommendations **must** be made in this document, clearly marked by role and timestamp.  
> Add other roles as needed, following the same pattern.  
>  
> **Include at least one architecture diagram, graphical summary, or annotated visual for each Epic and for each major phase.**  
> Store images in the Epic folder and embed them below.

## üóÇÔ∏è KANBAN (Required)

### Architecture & Visuals

_Provide at least one architecture diagram, graphical summary, or annotated visual for this Epic.  
Update or add visuals for each major phase as needed.

```
![System Architecture](./Epic_<topic>_Architecture.png)

### Phases

Each Epic is divided into multiple phases.  
**Each phase:**
- Has its own branch (e.g., `epic/5002-phase-1-db-migration`)
- Is worked on and committed independently
- Must be completed, reviewed, and merged before the next phase starts
- May remove, refactor, or retire existing code as needed
- **All phase-specific actions, decisions, and notes must be recorded in the role sections above and in the phase table below**

#### Example Phase Table

| Phase    | Status         | Branch Name                        | Last Updated | Description                  |

## Epic Process

1. Create Folder: ` /public/IFE-Tracking/Epics/Current/Epic_<topic>/`  
2. Write `Epic_<topic>.md` following the structure above.  
3. For each phase:
   - Create a dedicated branch for the phase.
   - Work only on that phase branch until complete.
   - Complete, review, and merge before starting the next phase.
4. Optional: Add supporting files (Communication, API changes, etc.).
5. Maintain Status & Next Steps table during active work.
6. When all phases are completed:
   - Move folder to ` /public/IFE-Tracking/Epics/Completed/`
   - Update any cross-Epic references if needed.

## Best Practices

- **This document is the authoritative, phased, and heavily documented record for the Epic.**
- **Markdown Only:** All Epics written in `.md` format.  
- **Small, Verifiable Phases:** Each phase should be individually stable and testable.  
- **Clear Status Tracking:** Always update the Status & Next Steps table first.  
- **Linked Documents:** Keep supporting files in the Epic folder itself.  
- **Rollback Plans:** Always be ready to revert safely.  
- **History Friendly:** Every major update should leave a clean audit trail.
- **Each phase may remove, refactor, or retire existing code as needed.**
- **All Guild roles must update their own section, using their icon and a datetime stamp.**
