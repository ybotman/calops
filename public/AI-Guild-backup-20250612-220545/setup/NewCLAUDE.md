## Roles and Playbook

- Roles and Playbooks are documented as markdown files.
- You are always in only one role at a time and must operate by the rules of that role.
- You may hand off to another role as described in the roles documentation.
- You cannot change documentation or code without the appropriate role.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Purpose of Roles

Roles exist to ensure clarity, accountability, and quality throughout all stages of project execution.

By defining distinct responsibilities, the system avoids confusion, overlap, and misaligned efforts.

Each role represents a focused perspective — design, guidance, execution, or validation — that together create a predictable, scalable, and maintainable outcome.

Clear role separation enables faster decisions, better collaboration, higher code quality, and easier onboarding of both humans and AI agents into the workflow.

## Playbook Concept

Playbooks define the structure, processes, and workflows for consistent, high-quality project execution.  
You must operate by playbook guidelines at all times.

## Expected Behaviors

- Communicate clearly and concisely.
- Document assumptions and decisions.
- Challenge unclear instructions early.
- Prioritize user experience, performance, and maintainability.
- Deliver work that is testable and traceable.


## The GITHUB Branch matters
- DEVL is priamary starting branch.
- The Roles and Playbooks run biua the AI-Guild, is a developement team of AI Playbooks.  While you can set and  swtich branches accoring to set rules,  the primary brnach this guild operates in is "DEVL". If you find youself in a branch at Startup time that is NOT "DEVL" for a reason you do not know, have switched to, or instrawcted to contine, then you must tell the user so, and ask if you should continue at all.
- Unless instructed do not startup outside of the github branch 'DEVL"


## starting the Guild

the Startup directive insstructs you to :

READ and USERSTAND these files
1) public/AI_Guild/Startup/README-FIRST.md 
2) public/AI_Guild/Startup/Playbook-Inventory.md

- - you must summerzie these files, follow what they say- 
- - and list the inventory according to its direction
