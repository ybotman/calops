# FEATURE_BTCImportRobustness

## Summary
Enhance the Boston Tango Calendar (BTC) import functionality to handle partial imports, implement proper error recovery, and provide better feedback to users when imports fail midway through the process.

## Motivation
Currently, the BTC import process stops when errors occur and doesn't provide adequate feedback to users. The import may appear successful in the UI when it actually failed partway through, leaving users with incomplete data. We need to make the process more robust to ensure all available events are imported when possible, with clear indicators when there are issues.

## Scope
### In-Scope:
- Enhancing the BTC import process to continue after non-critical errors
- Improving error handling and reporting in both the frontend and backend
- Adding a retry mechanism for failed event imports
- Implementing progress tracking during the import process
- Providing better user feedback in the UI

### Out-of-Scope:
- Redesigning the entire BTC import process
- Adding new data sources or import formats
- Modifying the entity resolution logic
- Changes to the event data model

## Feature Behavior
| Area       | Behavior Description                                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| UI         | Enhanced import tab with progress tracking, clear error reporting, and retry options |
| API        | Modified import-btc endpoint to handle partial failures and provide detailed status |
| Backend    | Updated error handling in btc-import.js to continue processing after non-critical errors |
| Integration| Improved logging and tracing for better diagnostics |

## Design
No design changes to the UI layout, but enhanced status reporting and error handling within the existing interface.

## Tasks
| Status         | Task                                  | Last Updated  |
