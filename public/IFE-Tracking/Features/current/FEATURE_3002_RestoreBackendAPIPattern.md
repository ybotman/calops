**Rollback Required From Feature 3001:**

**Files to Revert:**
- `src/app/api/users/route.js` - Remove direct MongoDB, restore axios proxy
- `src/app/api/roles/route.js` - Remove direct MongoDB, restore axios proxy  
- `src/app/api/organizers/route.js` - Remove direct MongoDB, restore axios proxy

**UI Components to Remove:**
- `src/components/DatabaseEnvironmentSwitcher.js`
- `src/components/DatabaseEnvironmentSync.js` 
- `src/lib/DatabaseContext.js`
- Database switcher integration in AdminLayout

**Infrastructure to Clean:**
- `src/lib/api-database.js` - Remove getApiDatabase functions
- Database environment header handling in api-client
- Environment selection state management

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECT (Required)
_User-approved decisions, technical recommendations, and rationale.  
Document all architectural notes and user approvals here._  
**Last updated:** 2025-01-28 23:05

**Architecture Decision: Restore Backend Proxy Pattern - APPROVED**

**Rationale for Rollback:**
1. **Database Connection Constraint**: Backend service controls its own database connections via environment variables
2. **MongoDB Timeout Issues**: Direct database connections experiencing 10-second timeouts  
3. **Operational Complexity**: Direct database pattern adds unnecessary complexity
4. **Reliability**: Backend proxy pattern is proven and stable

**Restore Strategy:**
1. **Revert API Routes**: Restore original axios proxy implementations with BE_URL
2. **Preserve Performance**: Keep any performance optimizations that don't require direct database access
3. **Clean Removal**: Remove all database switching infrastructure completely
4. **Test Validation**: Ensure backend service connectivity and performance

**Target Architecture:**
- All API routes use `axios.get(${BE_URL}/api/...)` pattern
- Single database environment controlled by backend service configuration
- No frontend database switching capability
- Simplified, reliable architecture

## üõ†Ô∏è BUILDER (Required)
_Implementation details, blockers, and technical choices.  
Document what was built, how, and any issues encountered._

## Summary
Rollback Feature 3001 database environment switching functionality and restore all API routes to use backend proxy pattern for reliability and operational simplicity.

## Motivation
- Resolve MongoDB connection timeout issues
- Restore operational reliability and consistency
- Simplify architecture by removing direct database complexity
- Ensure all routes work consistently through backend service

## Scope
- **In-Scope:** Rollback direct MongoDB routes, remove switching UI, restore backend proxy
- **Out-of-Scope:** Backend service configuration changes, new functionality additions

## Feature Behavior
| Area       | Behavior Description                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| UI         | Remove database environment switcher from dashboard   |
| API        | All routes restored to backend proxy pattern          |
| Backend    | Single database environment controlled by backend     |
| Integration | Simplified axios-based API calls                     |
