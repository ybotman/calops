**BTC Import Assessment Results:**

**Files Containing BTC Import Functionality (12 total):**

**UI Components (3 files):**
- `src/features/events/components/tabs/BtcImportTab.js` - BTC event import UI
- `src/features/events/components/tabs/BtcOrganizerTab.js` - BTC organizer import UI
- `src/components/venues/components/ImportVenuesDialog.js` - BTC venue import dialog

**API Routes (3 directories):**
- `src/app/api/events/import-btc/` - BTC event import endpoints
- `src/app/api/venues/import-btc/` - BTC venue import endpoints  
- `src/app/api/organizers/test-create/` - BTC organizer import endpoint

**Scripts and Utilities (6 files):**
- `btc-import.js` - Root level BTC import script
- `entity-resolution.js` - Entity resolution utility
- `error-handler.js` - Error handling utility
- `check-api.js` - API checking utility
- `scripts/btc-import/` - BTC import scripts directory
- `import-results/` - BTC import results directory

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk**: These are isolated BTC import features not used by core functionality
- **No Dependencies**: Removal should not affect core application operations
- **Clean Removal**: All BTC references can be safely removed
