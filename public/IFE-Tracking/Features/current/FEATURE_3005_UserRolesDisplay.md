## Summary
Fix the Users Grid role display that currently shows "UNK" by using backend API to fetch cached role values and display the smallest coded value for each role.

## Motivation
Users Grid currently displays "UNK" for user roles instead of meaningful role names, making it difficult to understand user permissions and assignments at a glance.

## Scope
**In-Scope:**
- Users Grid role column enhancement
- Backend API integration for role data
- Role display using smallest coded value
- Cached role values retrieval (~10 roles)

**Out-of-Scope:** 
- Role management or editing functionality
- User assignment to roles
- Role permissions modification

## Feature Behavior
| Area       | Behavior Description                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| UI         | Users Grid displays actual role names instead of "UNK" |
| API        | Fetch cached role values from backend endpoint        |
| Display    | Show smallest coded value for each role                |
| Data       | Use cached role data (~10 total roles)                |

## Requirements Detail
- **Current Issue:** Users Grid shows "UNK" for roles
- **Solution:** Use backend API to get cached role values (approximately 10 roles)
- **Display:** Show the "smallest coded value" for each role
- **Data Source:** Backend cached role values

## Dependencies
- Users Grid component
- Backend API roles endpoint
- Cached role data structure
- Understanding of "smallest coded value" format
