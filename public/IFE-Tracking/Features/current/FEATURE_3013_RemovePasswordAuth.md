## üé´ Kanban
- **Created**: 2025-01-06
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Type**: Security Enhancement
- **Branch**: `feature/3013-remove-password-auth` (merged and deleted)
- **Merged to DEVL**: 2025-01-06T1815

## Description
Remove the temporary password-based authentication system to prepare for Firebase role-based access control (RBAC) implementation. This simplifies the codebase and removes the security risk of storing password hashes in the repository.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Remove all password authentication components
- Delete login page and API routes
- Remove password storage
- Disable authentication middleware temporarily
- Remove logout functionality

### Out of Scope
- Firebase RBAC implementation (future work)
- User role management (future work)

## Changes Made

### Files Deleted
1. `/src/app/api/auth/` - Password verification API route
2. `/src/app/login/` - Login page component
3. `/public/pwd/` - Password hash storage directory

### Files Modified
1. **src/middleware.js**
   - Removed all authentication checks
   - All routes now publicly accessible
   - Added comments for future Firebase RBAC

2. **src/components/AdminLayout.js**
   - Removed logout button from navigation
   - Removed ExitToAppIcon import

## Impact
- **Security**: Removes password hash from repository
- **Access**: All routes are temporarily public (acceptable for development)
- **Code Simplification**: Removes unused authentication code
- **Future Ready**: Preserves Firebase infrastructure for RBAC

## Testing
- [x] Dashboard page loads without authentication
- [x] All navigation links work
- [x] No references to deleted files
- [x] Application builds successfully
- [x] No console errors

## Next Steps
1. Implement Firebase RBAC with role-based access
2. Add user role management UI
3. Restore route protection with Firebase auth
4. Add proper user session management

## Notes
- Firebase libraries (firebase-auth.js, firebase-admin.js) retained for future use
- AuthProvider wrapper still present in layout.js
- ProtectedRoute component available for future implementation
