## Summary
Enhance Organizer Management by replacing the "User Connected" Y/N column with a "Linked User" column showing actual user names, and add a "Default Mastered Values" column with filtering capability.

## Motivation
Current Organizer Management table shows only Y/N for user connections, making it difficult to see which specific user is linked to each organizer. Additionally, default mastered values need to be visible and filterable for better organizer management.

## Scope
**In-Scope:**
- Replace "User Connected" Y/N column with "Linked User" name column
- Add "Default Mastered Values" column
- Implement filtering for Default Mastered Values column
- Organizer Management table enhancement

**Out-of-Scope:** 
- User-organizer connection creation/editing functionality
- Organizer creation or deletion
- Full organizer profile management
