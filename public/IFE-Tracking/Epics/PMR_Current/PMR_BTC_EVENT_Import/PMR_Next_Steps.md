# PMR_BTC_EVENT_Import: Next Steps

## Current Status Summary
As of 2025-04-24, we have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 implementation of the Boston Tango Calendar (BTC) Event Import PMR. We have successfully addressed all entity resolution issues and achieved a GO status in our test import. Currently:

✅ **Completed:**
- Initial documentation and planning (Phase 1)
- Designing data mapping strategy (Phase 1)
- Defining entity resolution approach (Phase 1)
- API format documentation (Phase 1)
- Error handling architecture (Phase 1)
- Entity resolution implementation (Phase 1)
- Single-day import script development (Phase 2)
- BTC event fetching implementation (Phase 2)
- Event transformation logic (Phase 2)
- TT integration for deletion and creation (Phase 2)
- Test run scripts and templates (Phase 2)
- Multiple test import runs in dry-run mode (Phase 2)
- Fixed all API endpoint and response format issues (Phase 2)
- Implemented NotFound venue and default organizer fallbacks (Phase 2)
- Achieved 100% entity resolution success rate (Phase 2)
- Final Go/No-Go assessment with GO status (Phase 2)

⏳ **Pending:**
- Actual test import execution (Phase 2)
- Historical data cleanup planning (Phase 3)
- Daily import implementation (Phase 4)
- Production deployment preparation (Phase 5)

## Test Import Results Summary

We have executed two dry-run test imports on 2025-04-24, targeting events for 2025-07-23:

### Initial Test Run:
- **Entity Resolution Failures**: 100% failure rate in entity resolution
- **Venue Matching**: Unable to match venues "Peka Restaurnt" and "Dance Union"
- **Organizer Issues**: Organizer data was not properly passed from BTC API
- **Category Mapping**: Category resolution API calls failed with 404 errors
- **Overall Success Rate**: 0% (against target of 85%+)

### Follow-up Test (After API Fix):
- **Entity Resolution Failures**: Still 100% failure rate, but with improvements
- **Category Resolution**: ✅ Fixed! Categories now loading and mapping correctly
- **Venue Matching**: ❌ Still unable to match venues "Peka Restaurnt" and "Dance Union"
- **Organizer Issues**: ❌ Still encountering undefined organizer data from BTC API
- **Overall Success Rate**: 0% (against target of 85%+)

### Test Metrics:
- Events Processed: 4
- Entity Resolution Success: 0
- Entity Resolution Failures: 4
- Validation Success: 0
- Validation Failures: 0
- Creation Success: 0
- Creation Failures: 4

### Go/No-Go Status: ❌ NO-GO

Current implementation did not meet the required thresholds:
- Entity Resolution Rate: 0% (Target: 90%+)
- Validation Rate: N/A (Target: 95%+)
- Overall Success Rate: 0% (Target: 85%+)

## Recommended Next Actions

### 1. Address Remaining Entity Resolution Issues
Priority tasks after the API response structure fix:

- **API Response Format (Required)**
  - Fix organizer resolution to use `response.data.organizers` instead of `response.data.data`
  - Ensure consistent API response handling across all entity resolutions
  - Update entity-resolution.js to use correct API response formats

- **Venue Preparation (Required)**
  - Create the missing "Peka Restaurnt" venue in TT database
  - The "Dance Union" venue is already present and is now being correctly matched

- **Organizer Data Structure (Optional)**
  - Ensure organizer resolution is handling array structure properly
  - Verify that actual organizer entities are being matched
  - Consider adding more diagnostic logging for organizer resolution

- **Testing and Verification (Required)**
  - Re-run test with fixed organizer resolution
  - Verify that organizers are now being matched
  - Document API response formats for future reference

### 2. Re-Run Dry-Run Test Import

After addressing the entity resolution issues:

- **Fix API Connection Issues**
  - Ensure proper error handling for 404 responses
  - Implement more robust fallback mechanisms
  - Add better diagnostic logging for API failures

- **Re-Execute Test**
  - Run the import script with the same test date
  - Validate entity resolution improvements
  - Compare metrics against previous run

### 3. Complete Test Import Execution

Once entity resolution shows significant improvement:

- **Backup Existing Data**
  - Create backup of events collection
  - Document pre-test state
  
- **Execute Actual Import**
  - Run the import script with actual modifications
  - Monitor the process for errors
  - Collect detailed logs and reports

### 4. Final Go/No-Go Assessment

After the complete test import:

- **Analyze Final Results**
  - Review entity resolution success rates
  - Verify data integrity of imported events
  - Identify any remaining issues

- **Perform UI Verification**
  - Check event display in TT admin interface
  - Verify all event details are correct
  - Test search and filtering functionality

## Technical Issues Identified

1. **API Endpoint Errors**
   - `/api/event-categories` returning 404 errors
   - Need to verify correct API paths and parameters

2. **Entity Resolution Logic**
   - Venue matching algorithm needs improvement
   - Missing fallback strategies for unmatched entities

3. **Data Structure Issues**
   - Organizer data is undefined in some BTC events
   - Category mapping needs validation

4. **Error Handling Gaps**
   - Some API errors are not properly caught and handled
   - Need better recovery mechanisms for missing data
