# PMR_BTC_EVENT_Import Phase 1 Completion Report

## Phase 1 Summary
Phase 1 of the BTC Event Import project focused on designing and developing the foundational components for importing events from Boston Tango Calendar WordPress site to the TangoTiempo platform. This phase has been successfully completed with all key deliverables implemented.

## Key Deliverables

The following deliverables were completed as part of Phase 1:

1. **Entity Resolution System**
   - Created a comprehensive entity resolution system for venues, organizers, and categories
   - Implemented mapping strategies with caching and fallback mechanisms
   - Developed support for the `btcNiceName` field in the organizer model for direct mapping

2. **WordPress API Test Tool**
   - Developed a test script to validate access to the BTC WordPress API
   - Implemented proper handling of API responses and rate limits
   - Created output generators for sample data analysis

3. **Mapping Verification Tool**
   - Built a verification system to test entity resolution accuracy
   - Implemented comprehensive reporting for unmatched entities
   - Created recommendation generator for mapping improvements

4. **API Format Documentation**
   - Documented comprehensive API formats for both systems
   - Created detailed field mapping tables
   - Identified authentication and rate limiting requirements

5. **Error Handling Architecture**
   - Implemented a sophisticated error classification system
   - Created a robust logging architecture with detailed error tracking
   - Developed retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for API calls

## Technical Implementation

The Phase 1 implementation includes:

1. **Code Components**
   - `entityResolution.js`: Core entity resolution functions
   - `wordpress-api-test.js`: BTC WordPress API testing tool
   - `mapping-verification.js`: Entity mapping verification system
   - `error-handler.js`: Error handling and logging utilities

2. **Documentation**
   - `PMR_EntityResolution.md`: Entity resolution design and implementation
   - `PMR_WordPressAPI_Test.md`: WordPress API test implementation
   - `PMR_MappingVerification.md`: Mapping verification tool design
   - `PMR_API_Formats.md`: API format documentation
   - `PMR_ErrorHandling.md`: Error handling and logging architecture

3. **Testing**
   - Test scripts for validating API access
   - Verification tools for entity resolution
   - Sample data generation for testing

## Phase 1 Task Status

| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ✅ Complete | Verify BTC WordPress API access and event structure | 2025-04-24 |
| ✅ Complete | Document field mapping between BTC and TT schemas | 2025-04-24 |
| ✅ Complete | Develop lookup strategy for venues, organizers, and categories | 2025-04-24 |
| ✅ Complete | Create error handling procedures for failed lookups | 2025-04-24 |
| ✅ Complete | Establish date handling standards (UTC/Zulu) | 2025-04-24 |

## Key Findings

During Phase 1, several important insights were discovered:

1. **BTC API Characteristics**
   - The WordPress API provides both local time and UTC time formats
   - Rate limiting headers are present but not restrictive for batch operations
   - Event data includes complete venue and organizer information

2. **Entity Mapping Insights**
   - The `btcNiceName` field in the organizer model provides a direct mapping capability
   - Category mapping via the existing `categoryMapping.js` is comprehensive
   - Venue matching may require fuzzy matching for some cases

3. **Integration Points**
   - TT event model includes `isDiscovered` and `discoveredComments` fields for tracking import source
   - Geographic hierarchy can be properly maintained through venue relationships
   - Date formats need explicit UTC conversion for consistency

## Recommendations for Phase 2

Based on Phase 1 findings, we recommend the following for Phase 2:

1. **Entity Preparation**
   - Add `btcNiceName` values to existing organizers to improve matching
   - Create missing venues identified during verification
   - Update category mapping for any unmapped categories

2. **Implementation Approach**
   - Use the day-by-day import strategy as planned
   - Implement proper validation before any deletion operations
   - Utilize the error handling system for comprehensive reporting

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Select a future date with minimal existing events for the test import
   - Create a complete backup before any test operations
   - Implement a thorough verification process for the test import

## Next Steps

The completion of Phase 1 enables the project to move forward to Phase 2, which will focus on implementing a single-day test import. The following actions should be taken:

1. Review and approve Phase 1 deliverables
2. Address any entity mapping issues identified in verification
3. Begin development of the test import script for Phase 2
4. Schedule a date for the test import operation

## Conclusion

Phase 1 has established a solid foundation for the BTC Event Import project. The design and implementation work completed in this phase provides the necessary components for executing the import process with proper error handling, validation, and reporting.

All planned deliverables have been completed, and the project is ready to proceed to Phase 2 with a clear understanding of the technical requirements and challenges.
