# PMR_UserPageRefactor

## Summary
This PMR outlines a comprehensive refactoring of the Users page in the CalOps administration application. The current implementation is a monolithic component of over 1,300 lines that combines UI rendering, data fetching, state management, and business logic in a single file. This refactoring will separate these concerns, improve code organization, enhance maintainability, and establish patterns for similar refactoring efforts throughout the application.

## Scope
### Inclusions
- Complete restructuring of the UsersPage.js component architecture
- Extraction of presentation components for reusability
- Creation of custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Implementation of improved error handling and data loading patterns
- Optimization of role mapping and filtering logic
- Enhancement of user management operations with proper separation of concerns
- Documentation of the new architecture and component relationships

### Exclusions
- Changes to the backend API endpoints
- Functional changes to user management features
- Authentication system modifications
- Major UI redesign (focus is on code structure, not visual changes)
- Database schema changes

## Motivation
The current Users page implementation exhibits several issues that reduce maintainability and increase development complexity:

1. **Code Size**: At 1,300+ lines, the component is difficult to understand and navigate
2. **Mixed Concerns**: UI rendering, data fetching, and business logic are tightly coupled
3. **Repetitive Code**: Similar UI structures are duplicated across tab panels
4. **Complex State Management**: Managing form state, filtering, and API interactions in one component
5. **Challenging Error Handling**: Error handling scattered throughout the component
6. **Difficult Testing**: The monolithic structure makes unit testing nearly impossible
7. **Debugging Challenges**: Finding issues requires searching through hundreds of lines of code

This refactoring will address these issues by implementing modern React patterns and best practices.

## Changes
- **Frontend:** Split monolithic component into smaller, focused components with separate responsibilities
- **Frontend:** Extract data fetching and state management into custom hooks for better separation of concerns
- **Frontend:** Implement consistent error handling patterns throughout the application
- **Frontend:** Optimize role mapping and processing logic for better performance
- **Frontend:** Add comprehensive documentation for the new architecture

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking existing functionality | Comprehensive test plan with exact feature parity validation |
| Introducing performance regressions | Performance benchmarking before and after changes |
| Extended development time | Phased implementation with incremental improvements |
| Missing edge cases in current implementation | Code review and pair programming during refactoring |
| Increased complexity from splitting code | Clear documentation and consistent patterns across components |

## Rollback Strategy
1. Keep the original UsersPage.js component in a backup file (UsersPage.original.js)
2. Implement feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations
3. Test both implementations side by side before final deployment
4. If issues are found after deployment:
   - Use Git to revert the component changes to the previous version
   - Toggle feature flag to use original implementation
   - Restore any configuration changes made during implementation

## Dependencies
- React 18+ functionality
- MUI components (v5+)
- Existing API client libraries (usersApi, rolesApi)
- Role and user data schemas
- UserEditForm component
