# PMR_UserManagement

## Summary
This PMR outlines the process for upgrading the user management functionality in the CalOps administration application to improve usability, performance, and data presentation, while ensuring better integration with the backend API.

## Scope
### Inclusions
- Redesign of the All Users tab with enhanced data display
- Implementation of the Temp Users cleanup functionality
- Overhaul of the user creation process
- Improvements to user editing capabilities
- Backend API integration optimizations
- Enhanced role management functionality

### Exclusions
- Changes to the backend API endpoints themselves
- Authentication system modifications (Firebase)
- User login/logout flow modifications
- Changes to the admin dashboard navigation

## Motivation
The current user management interface lacks important data visibility, has performance issues when displaying large user lists, and contains several UI inconsistencies. Additionally, the temporary user management process is cumbersome and error-prone. This PMR addresses these issues to provide administrators with more efficient user management tools.

## Changes
- **Frontend:** Redesign of users page with enhanced filtering, sorting, and batch actions
- **API Integration:** Improved error handling and caching of user data
- **Data Model:** Enhanced display of user attributes and role assignments
- **Performance:** Optimized data loading and pagination for large user lists

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Data loss during user updates | Implement confirmation dialogs and undo functionality |
| API compatibility issues | Add backward compatibility layer with clear error messages |
| Performance degradation with large datasets | Implement pagination and virtualized lists |
| Role assignment conflicts | Add validation checks before saving role changes |

## Rollback Strategy
1. Archive new implementation components
2. Restore previous users page implementation
3. Test with verified test users
4. Revert any database changes if necessary

## Dependencies
- MongoDB user collection schema
- Firebase authentication integration
- Role management API endpoints
- Backend API version compatibility

- Train administrators on new features

# Phase 1: User Interface Redesign

### Goals
Redesign the user management interface for improved usability and data visibility while maintaining existing functionality.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Redesign UI for All Users tab with improved filtering | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Implement sortable and filterable data grid | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Add batch selection functionality for multi-user operations | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Create new user details panel with expandable sections | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Design confirmation dialogs for critical operations | 2025-04-23 |

### Rollback (if needed)
1. Restore original components from version control
2. Reset CSS styles to previous version
3. Verify all routes work with previous implementation

### Notes
The UI redesign should maintain existing URL structure and route functionality while improving visual organization and data accessibility.

# Phase 2: API Integration Optimization

### Goals
Improve performance and reliability of backend API integration for user management.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Implement client-side caching for user data | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Create data fetching abstraction layer | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Add error recovery mechanisms | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Implement optimistic updates for faster UI response | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Create retry mechanism for failed API requests | 2025-04-23 |

### Rollback (if needed)
1. Revert API client changes
2. Restore original data fetching implementations
3. Test with verified API endpoints

### Notes
Focus on maintaining backward compatibility while improving performance. All changes should be incremental and well-tested before proceeding to the next phase.

# Phase 3: Temporary User Management

### Goals
Implement robust tools for managing temporary users, including improved visualization and bulk operations.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Create visual indicators for temp users | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Implement bulk conversion tool for temp users | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Add selective deletion functionality | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Create temp user creation wizard | 2025-04-23 |
| ⏳ Pending | Implement bulk metadata assignment for temp users | 2025-04-23 |

### Rollback (if needed)
1. Disable new temp user features
2. Restore previous temporary user handling
3. Verify temp user identification still works

### Notes
Temporary users require special handling due to their incomplete authentication state. Provide clear warnings and confirmation steps before bulk operations.

# Phase 4: Role Management Enhancement

### Goals
Improve the role assignment and permission management interface for users.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|--------|------|--------------|
| ⏳ Pending | Create role inheritance visualization | 2025-04-23 |

3. Verify users still have correct role assignments

### Notes
Role management changes must maintain strict security boundaries while improving usability for administrators.

# Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

### Rollback (if needed)
1. Immediate rollback to previous version if critical issues found
2. Database state restoration from backups if necessary
3. Notification to all administrators of system status

### Notes
Testing should include both normal operations and edge cases, particularly around temporary user conversion and role assignment.
