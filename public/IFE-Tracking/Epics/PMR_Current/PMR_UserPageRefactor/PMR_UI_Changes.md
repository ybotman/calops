# PMR_UserPageRefactor - UI Changes Documentation

## Overview

This document details the UI components that will be refactored as part of the User Page Refactoring PMR. While the refactoring focuses primarily on code structure rather than visual changes, this document provides a comprehensive reference for the UI components involved.

## UI Component Changes

### TabPanel Component

**Current Implementation:**
- Defined inline within UsersPage.js (lines 34-49)
- Simple wrapper that conditionally renders children based on tab value
- No PropTypes defined

**Refactored Implementation:**
- Extracted to standalone component in `/components/common/TabPanel.js`
- Added comprehensive PropTypes documentation
- Enhanced with accessibility attributes
- No visual changes to the component

### User Table Component

**Current Implementation:**
- Directly integrated in the UsersPage.js component
- Repeated multiple times across different tabs
- Complex column definitions mixed with rendering logic

**Refactored Implementation:**
- Extracted to dedicated UserTable component
- Configurable columns through props
- Consistent error state and loading indicators
- Same visual appearance but with improved performance

### Status Display Component

**Current Implementation:**
- Complex inline render function in columns definition (lines 952-1032)
- Multiple nested Box components for status indicators
- Duplicated styling logic

**Refactored Implementation:**
- Extracted to StatusDisplay component
- Accepts user status objects as props
- Consistent styling applied through theme variables
- Improved tooltip information
- Same visual appearance

### Search Bar Component

**Current Implementation:**
- Integrated directly in UsersPage.js
- Coupled with search state and handlers
- Simple TextField with InputAdornment

**Refactored Implementation:**
- Extracted to UserSearchBar component
- Accepts onSearch callback and initial value props
- Enhanced with clear button functionality
- Maintains same visual appearance

### Dialog Components

**Current Implementation:**
- Add User Dialog: Inline in UsersPage.js (lines 1232-1316)
- User Edit Dialog: Connected directly to UserEditForm

**Refactored Implementation:**
- Extracted to standalone dialog components
- Clear separation between dialog container and content
- Same visual appearance and functionality
- Improved prop validation

## User Flows

No changes to user flows will be made during this refactoring. All interactions will maintain their current behavior and appearance:

- Searching users
- Filtering by tab (All Users, Organizers, Admins)
- Creating new users
- Editing existing users
- Deleting users
- Managing user roles
- Creating organizers

## Styling Changes

- No intentional styling changes in the refactoring
- All components will maintain the same visual appearance
- Component styles will be refactored to use theme variables consistently
- Minor improvements to meet accessibility standards

## Validation & Testing

UI validation will include:

1. Visual regression testing to ensure components appear identical
2. Testing with various screen sizes to verify responsive behavior
3. Accessibility testing to ensure components meet WCAG standards
4. End-to-end testing of all user flows
