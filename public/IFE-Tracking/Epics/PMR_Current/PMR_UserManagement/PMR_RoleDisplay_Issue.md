# Role Display Issue Analysis & Resolution

## Issue Summary
The user management interface was displaying `?` characters instead of the correct role codes (e.g., "NU, RA") in the Roles column. The role IDs were present in the user data, but the system couldn't match them to their corresponding role codes.

## Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, we identified this as a **React closure issue**:

1. The `refreshUsers` function was defined at the component level, capturing the initial value of `roles` (an empty array)
2. When `fetchData` called `refreshUsers()` after loading the roles data, the function was still using the empty array from its closure
3. This meant that even though `setRoles(processedRoles)` was called, the state update hadn't yet affected the captured value inside the `refreshUsers` function
4. Since `roles.length` was 0, no matches could be found for any role ID, resulting in `?` characters

Debugging logs confirmed this sequence:
```
Searching among 0 available roles for ID: 66cb85ac74dca51e34e268ed
No exact match found, trying MongoDB ObjectID format for 66cb85ac74dca51e34e268ed
```

The backend API was correctly providing the role data, but the React component couldn't properly access it due to this closure issue.

## Solution Implemented
We implemented a robust solution to eliminate the closure issue:

1. Modified the `refreshUsers` function to accept a `currentRoles` parameter
2. Created a `rolesToUse` variable that prioritizes the passed parameter over the state value
3. Updated all instances in the function to use `rolesToUse` instead of directly accessing `roles`
4. Modified the calling code to directly pass the freshly loaded roles to `refreshUsers`
5. Added improved error handling and logging for better debugging

This approach ensures that when processing user data to display role codes, the function always has access to the most up-to-date roles data, even if the React state hasn't fully updated yet.

## Benefits
- Resolved the display issue completely
- Improved error handling and logging for future troubleshooting
- Fixed a potential source of inconsistency in other data processing
- Enhanced the reliability of the user interface

## Lessons Learned
This incident highlights the importance of understanding React's closure behavior when working with asynchronous operations and state updates. State updates do not immediately affect the values captured in function closures, which can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to diagnose without proper logging.

For future implementations, consider:
1. Passing required data as parameters to functions instead of relying on closure-captured state
2. Implementing debug logging around state access in asynchronous contexts
3. Using React's useCallback with appropriate dependencies to ensure functions always have access to fresh state
