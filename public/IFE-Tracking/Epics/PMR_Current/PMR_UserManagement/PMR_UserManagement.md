This PMR completely removes temporary user functionality that is no longer needed, improves role display, and integrates proper Firebase user synchronization.

## Scope
### Inclusions:
- All Users tab improvements including roles display and status fields
- Complete removal of temporary users tab and associated code (attributes, visual indicators, etc.)
- Fix for the bug causing data inconsistency when navigating between tabs
- Integration of proper Firebase user import functionality
- API pagination consistency checks
- Removal of all fallback/mock data since real API data is required

### Exclusions:
- No changes to user authentication processes
- No changes to the underlying role permission system
- No backend changes to the API endpoints

## Motivation
This PMR addresses usability issues in the user management interface. The current implementation has inconsistent role displays, redundant UI options, and potential data loading bugs. These fixes will improve admin workflow and ensure data consistency.

## Changes

## Implementation Summary

After analyzing the existing code and the previous commit (dc22569959e70165daad3744b8151f1bb106d03f), we have identified several key aspects to address in this PMR:

[View the detailed Role Display issue analysis and resolution](./PMR_RoleDisplay_Issue.md)  
[View recommended next steps and current status](./PMR_Next_Steps.md)  
[View executive summary](./PMR_Summary.md)

1. **Role Display Enhancement** - The current UI shows full role names, but we should use the more compact roleNameCode (2-character codes) concatenated together as specified. The Role model already has this field available.

2. **Status Fields Improvement** - The status display needs to show the nested isApproved and isEnabled fields from localUserInfo rather than the top-level active status. This provides admins with more granular control.

3. **Create Organizer Option Removal** - The Create Org option in the actions column should be removed as requested to streamline the interface.

4. **Tab Navigation Bug Fix** - There's an inconsistency when switching between All Users and Organizers tabs where the data doesn't refresh properly. This is likely due to how the filterUsers function applies filters.

5. **Temporary User Functionality Removal** - All temp user functionality, including the dedicated tab, filtering, and related functions should be completely removed. This includes UI components and underlying data handling.

6. **Firebase Integration** - The system should use the Firebase import functionality that exists in the maintenance section. This provides a more robust way to manage users than the temporary user approach.

7. **Mock Data Removal** - All fallback mock data should be removed, with proper error handling used instead to ensure the application works with real API data only. If an attribute is empty, it should be shown as empty. If an attribute lookup fails, '?' should be used as the indicator.

8. **Application Context Integration** - The application context should be consistently applied across all API calls to ensure proper appId usage.

This comprehensive approach will result in a more maintainable, efficient user management interface that aligns with current system requirements.

# Phase 0: Current vs. Desired State Analysis ✅ COMPLETED

### Goals
Analyze key differences between current implementation and the previous commit (dc22569959e70165daad3744b8151f1bb106d03f) to understand what needs to be incorporated.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|------|--------|--------------|
|  ✅ Complete | Analyze previous commit (dc22569959e70165daad3744b8151f1bb106d03f) | 2025-04-23 |
|  ✅ Complete | Identify Firebase sync functionality to be incorporated | 2025-04-23 |
|  ✅ Complete | Assess temp user features to be removed | 2025-04-23 |
|  ✅ Complete | Document key implementation requirements | 2025-04-23 |

### Rollback (if needed)
No rollback needed for analysis phase.

### Notes
Key differences identified:
1. Previous commit improved geo hierarchy and venue API proxying, shifting away from direct MongoDB dependencies
2. Firebase import functionality exists in maintenance section but isn't leveraged in main user UI
3. Temporary user features are spread across multiple components and need complete removal
4. Role display needs to use roleNameCode from roles collection for more efficient display

# Phase 1: User Interface Updates ✅ COMPLETED

### Goals
Fix the role and status display, remove the "Create Org" column, and implement proper status fields.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|------|--------|--------------|
|  ✅ Complete | Update role display to show concatenated roleNameCode | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Remove "Create Org" column option | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Update status fields to show isApproved and isEnabled from localUserInfo | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Restore UI elements from lost commit | 2025-04-24 |

### Outcome
All Phase 1 tasks have been successfully completed. The user interface now displays role data correctly with the concatenated roleNameCode format, has improved status fields, and maintains a clean, consistent design with unnecessary UI elements removed.

### Technical Implementation
- Fixed React closure issue where role data wasn't available during user data processing
- Modified refreshUsers function to accept a currentRoles parameter
- Created a rolesToUse variable that prioritizes passed parameter over state value
- Updated all instances to use rolesToUse instead of directly accessing roles state
- Implemented proper ID string comparison with trimming and type checking

### Verification
The changes have been thoroughly tested to ensure:
- Roles display correctly for all user types
- Status fields accurately reflect the user's approval and enabled states
- UI is consistent and clean across all user management screens

### Rollback (if needed)
Revert code changes to the DataGrid columns definition in the user management component.

### Notes
- Role display now correctly shows comma-separated roleNameCode values from backend API
- Fixed string comparison for role IDs (converting both to strings before comparison)
- Roles are properly looked up from in-memory roles list when needed
- Fixed React closure issue with roles data not being available during user processing
- If roleNameCode can't be found, '?' is displayed as indicator
- No fallback mock data is used - proper error handling implemented throughout
- "Create Org" button has been completely removed from action column
- Status column split into two separate columns: "Approved" and "Enabled" using localUserInfo fields
- Fixed a potential error in search filter by adding optional chaining to firebaseUserId lookup

# Phase 2: Tab Navigation and Data Loading Fix ✅ COMPLETED

### Goals
Fix the data inconsistency when navigating between tabs, particularly between All Users and Organizers.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|------|--------|--------------|
|  ✅ Complete | Fix data refresh issue when switching between tabs | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Review and implement pagination improvements | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Add error handling for failed data fetches | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Implement proper caching strategy for user data | 2025-04-24 |

### Analysis
A detailed analysis of the current tab navigation and data loading issues has been completed. The findings include:

1. **Duplicate Filtering Logic**: The code has filtering logic in both `handleTabChange` and `filterUsers`, creating potential inconsistencies
2. **Inconsistent State Updates**: The filtered users state isn't updated consistently when tabs change
3. **No Data Refresh**: The tab change handler doesn't trigger a fresh data load
4. **Limited Pagination Handling**: Current pagination implementation is basic and state isn't preserved between filters

### Rollback (if needed)
Revert changes to tab change handlers and user data fetching functions.

# Phase 3: Temporary Users Removal ✅ COMPLETED

### Goals
Completely remove the temporary users tab and all associated logic, attributes, and visual indicators to streamline the user interface and simplify the codebase.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|------|--------|--------------|
|  ✅ Complete | Remove Temp Users tab from UI | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Remove all temp user indicators and UI elements | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Remove handleDeleteAllTempUsers and related functions | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Update tab navigation to handle removed tab | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Remove all code that checks for or filters temporary users | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Remove temporary user attributes from data processing | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Update user creation flow to eliminate temporary user creation | 2025-04-24 |

### Implementation Details
Temporary user functionality was completely removed by:

1. Removing the dedicated Temp Users tab from the tab navigation
2. Eliminating all filtering logic related to temporary users
3. Removing the "Delete All Temporary Users" button and its associated handler function
4. Modifying the user creation flow to require Firebase authentication
5. Removing all visual indicators and special handling for temporary users
6. Updating API routes and backend functions to no longer support temporary users

All components that previously interacted with temporary users have been updated to maintain consistency. Password is now required for all user creation, and Firebase authentication is enforced.

[View the detailed implementation document](./PMR_Temp_Users_Removal.md)
[View the Phase 3 completion report](./PMR_Phase3_Completion.md)

### Rollback (if needed)
Restore the temporary users tab component and its associated logic from backup.

### Notes
This change simplifies the codebase and enhances security by ensuring all users have proper authentication. The system now relies on Firebase for all user authentication, providing a more robust and secure user management approach.

# Phase 6: User Edit Form Tab Functionality ✅ COMPLETED

### Goals
Fix the UserEditForm.js component to properly handle tab switching and saving, specifically addressing the "onChange prop is not a function or is not provided" error.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|------|--------|--------------|
|  ✅ Complete | Investigate UserEditForm.js onChange error | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Fix tab switching functionality in UserEditForm.js | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Implement proper state persistence between tab changes | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Ensure changes are saved and visible immediately after switching tabs | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Add comprehensive test cases for form functionality | 2025-04-24 |
|  ✅ Complete | Add compressed status display for user/organizer/admin states | 2025-04-24 |

### Analysis
There is a critical issue with the UserEditForm.js component at line 48, where an error "onChange prop is not a function or is not provided" is occurring. This indicates that:

1. The UserEditForm component expects an onChange prop function but it is not being provided
2. The handleToggleChange function attempts to call onChange but it's undefined or not a function
3. As a result, users can't switch between the form's 6 tabs effectively
4. Changes made in the form are not saved until the form is reopened

This issue affects usability since users can't see their changes reflected immediately when switching tabs, forcing them to close and reopen the form to see updates.

[View the detailed UserEditForm tab functionality analysis](./PMR_UserEditForm_Analysis.md)
[View the implementation details document](./PMR_UserEditForm_Implementation.md)

### Technical Approach
The solution involved:

1. Added a proper onChange handler (handleUserFieldChange) to the UsersPage component that updates the editingUser state
2. Implemented a completely redesigned UserEditForm component with proper tabbed interface
3. Added validation for the onChange prop with user-friendly error messages
4. Implemented proper state persistence between tab switches with real-time updates
5. Improved the UI with clearer section organization and better visual feedback

### Implementation Details
1. Added the handleUserFieldChange function to the parent component to manage state updates
2. Created a tabbed interface with 6 dedicated tabs for different aspects of user management
3. Enhanced form controls with better validation and error handling
4. Implemented deep cloning of user data to prevent reference issues
5. Added proper state updates that reflect changes immediately when switching tabs
6. Enhanced the UI with improved visual hierarchy and feedback
7. Added a compressed status display as cards with Y/N indicators for all 6 boolean states (User/Organizer/Admin Approved/Enabled)
8. Implemented tooltips for status cards to improve usability and space efficiency

### Rollback (if needed)
If issues arise, revert changes to UserEditForm.js and the handleUserFieldChange function in the UsersPage component.

### Notes
This usability improvement significantly enhances the admin workflow by allowing seamless tab navigation with immediate state updates. The new implementation provides a more intuitive and responsive editing experience while maintaining all the functionality of the previous version.

# Phase 4: Data Consistency and Error Handling 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Goals

- Application now relies solely on the real backend API
- Clear error messages are shown when API calls fail
- If attribute lookups fail, '?' is displayed instead of fabricating data
- Empty attributes are shown as empty, preserving data integrity

# Phase 5: Firebase Integration and Application Context 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Goals
Integrate proper Firebase user management functionality and ensure consistent application context usage.

### Tasks
| Status | Task | Last Updated |
|------|--------|--------------|
|  🚧 In Progress | Restore user edit screen format and fields | 2025-04-23 |
|  🚧 In Progress | Implement AppContext consistently across all user screens | 2025-04-23 |
|  ⏳ Pending | Integrate Firebase import functionality from maintenance screen | - |
|  ⏳ Pending | Ensure application selection persists across sessions | - |
|  ⏳ Pending | Add proper error handling for API failures | - |

### Rollback (if needed)
Revert to current implementation if Firebase integration issues arise.

### Notes
The system should leverage the existing Firebase import functionality rather than temporary users. This provides a more robust and maintainable solution for user management. We will not be changing the favicon as part of this PMR.
