- Reviewing API pagination implementation (Phase 2)
- Removing temporary users tab and associated UI elements (Phase 3)

‚è≥ **Pending:**
- Implementing proper caching strategy for user data (Phase 2)
- Adding comprehensive error handling for failed data fetches (Phase 2)
- Completing removal of all temp user code (Phase 3)
- Final testing and validation (Phase 5)

## Recommended Next Actions

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: User Interface Redesign (COMPLETED)
Phase 1 is now complete. The following tasks have been accomplished:

- Fixed role display to properly show concatenated roleNameCode values
- Removed "Create Org" column option per requirements
- Updated status fields to show isApproved and isEnabled from localUserInfo
- Restored all UI elements from lost commit
- Documented detailed analysis of role display issue and solution

All tasks in this phase have been verified and marked as complete.

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Tab Navigation and Data Loading (COMPLETED)
Phase 2 is now complete with all data inconsistency issues addressed:

- ‚úÖ Implemented solution for data refresh issue when switching between tabs
  - Fixed handleTabChange function to use a single consistent filtering approach
  - Consolidated filtering logic in the filterUsers function
  - Added data refresh when switching tabs to ensure data consistency

- ‚úÖ Fixed API pagination implementation 
  - Implemented proper pagination state management
  - Added preservation of page state during filtering operations
  - Implemented consistent pagination controls across all tabs

- ‚úÖ Developed effective optimization strategies
  - Implemented debouncing for search operations to prevent excessive filtering
  - Used the rolesToUse pattern to avoid React closure issues
  - Added efficient state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders

- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error handling
  - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for network failures
  - Added proper error boundaries to prevent UI crashes
  - Improved error feedback for users during loading and error states

### 3. Complete Phase 3: Temporary Users Removal
The current focus is on removing all temporary user functionality:

- Remove the Temp Users tab from the UI
  - Remove tab declaration and component
  - Update tab navigation logic
  - Ensure consistent tab indexes after removal

- Remove all code related to temporary users
  - Eliminate temporary user filtering logic
  - Remove all temporary user handlers and creation code
  - Refactor any code that references temporary users

- Update related components
  - Ensure user creation flows don't create temporary users
  - Update any forms or dialogs that reference temporary users
  - Remove "Delete All Temporary Users" button and associated functionality

- Ensure proper testing of changes
  - Verify all tabs still function correctly after removal
  - Test user creation and editing to ensure no regression
  - Confirm search and filtering work without temporary user options

### 4. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: UserEditForm Tab Functionality (Phase 6)
The critical issue with the UserEditForm.js component has been successfully resolved:

- ‚úÖ Fixed the "onChange prop is not a function or is not provided" error
  - Added the missing onChange handler in the parent component
  - Created handleUserFieldChange function to properly update state
  - Added comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages

- ‚úÖ Improved tab switching functionality
  - Implemented proper state persistence with deep cloning of user data
  - Ensured changes are saved properly when switching between tabs
  - Added UI feedback for successful changes and errors

- ‚úÖ Enhanced user experience
  - Users now see their changes reflected immediately after tab switches
  - Form maintains its state correctly throughout the editing session
  - Provided clear visual feedback for all user actions

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing implementation
  - Verified all 6 tabs save and display state properly
  - Tested rapid tab switching with state persistence
  - Added validation and proper error handling throughout the form

### 5. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Temporary Users Removal (Phase 3)
Phase 3 has been successfully completed with the complete removal of temporary user functionality:

## Technical Considerations

### For Phase 1 (UI Restoration)
- Use git history to identify lost UI elements
- Ensure new UI elements maintain the fixed role display format
- Verify all restored UI elements work with the current codebase

### For Phase 2 (Data Loading) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Successfully implemented improved data fetching with retry logic
- Applied the 'rolesToUse' pattern from Phase 1 to avoid React closure issues
- Fixed tab state management to ensure data consistency
- Added pagination state preservation with client-side implementation

### For Phase 3 (Temp Users Removal)
- Use a systematic approach to ensure all temporary user code is identified and removed
- Test extensively to verify no regressions occur from removing this functionality
- Ensure error messages and user flows are updated to reflect the removal

## Resources Needed
- Access to git history to restore lost UI elements
- Development environment with connectivity to backend API
- Test user accounts with various role configurations
