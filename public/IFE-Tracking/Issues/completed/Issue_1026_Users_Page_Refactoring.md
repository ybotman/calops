# Issue: Users Page Refactoring

## Overview
The User Management page (`src/app/dashboard/users/page.js`) is excessively large (1,349 lines) and contains a mixture of UI components, business logic, and API calls. This makes it difficult to maintain, test, and extend. The page needs refactoring to follow best practices for React component architecture, hooks, and API client usage.

## Details
- **Reported On:** 2025-04-27
- **Reported By:** Toby Balsley
- **Environment:** All environments
- **Component/Page/API Affected:** User Management page (`/src/app/dashboard/users/page.js`)
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Large monolithic component (1,349 lines)
  - Mixed concerns (UI, state management, API calls)
  - Inconsistent API access patterns (mix of direct axios calls and api-client.js)
  - Duplicated logic for data processing
  - Complex state management

## Technical Analysis

### Current Issues
1. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The `users/page.js` file is 1,349 lines long, making it difficult to understand and maintain
   - Contains multiple responsibilities that should be separated

2. **Inconsistent API Access**:
   - Some API calls use the centralized API client
   - Others make direct axios calls to the backend or local Next.js API routes
   - This inconsistency makes it harder to implement global error handling and caching

3. **Mixed UI and Logic**:
   - UI rendering, data fetching, and business logic are tightly coupled
   - Error handling is scattered throughout the component

4. **Complex State Management**:
   - Multiple useState hooks managing related state
   - Complex state updates with many dependencies
   - No clear separation between UI state and data state

5. **Limited Code Reuse**:
   - Functionality that could be reused is embedded directly in the component
   - Difficult to test or reuse parts of the implementation

### Proposed Refactoring

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Break down the page into smaller, focused components
   - Create a component hierarchy with clear responsibilities
   - Implement container/presentation pattern where appropriate

2. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Extract data fetching and business logic into custom hooks
   - Create dedicated hooks for user data, filtering, and pagination
   - Implement context providers where appropriate for shared state

3. **API Client Standardization**:
   - Consistently use the centralized API client for all backend calls
   - Extend the API client to cover all required endpoints
   - Add proper error handling and response normalization

4. **State Management**:
   - Reorganize state into logical groupings
   - Consider using useReducer for complex state interactions
   - Implement optimistic updates for better UX during edits

5. **Code Organization**:
   - Create a consistent folder structure for components, hooks, and utilities
   - Implement barrel exports (index.js files) for better imports
   - Add proper JSDoc comments for better maintainability

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- Create a component hierarchy diagram
- Identify all state and data flow requirements
- Define interface contracts between components
- Create a refactoring plan with clear milestones

### Phase 2: API Client Enhancement
- Update api-client.js to support all required user operations
- Implement consistent error handling and response formatting
- Add optional caching for frequently accessed data
- Create comprehensive tests for the API client

### Phase 3: Custom Hooks Development
- Implement useUsers hook for user data management
- Create useUserFilters hook for search and filtering
- Develop usePagination hook for DataGrid integration
- Add useUserForm hook for form handling

### Phase 4: Component Refactoring
- Create basic component structure
- Split page into logical container components
- Develop presentation components with clear props interfaces
- Implement responsive UI improvements

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- Connect all components using the new hooks
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add loading states and error boundaries
- Ensure 100% feature parity with current implementation

## Expected Benefits
- Improved maintainability through smaller, focused components
- Better testability with clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced performance through optimized rendering
- Easier feature additions in the future
- Consistent patterns that can be applied to other areas of the application

## Fix
- **Status:** âœ… Fixed
- **Fix Description:** 
  1. Created modular API client with standardized interfaces for all user operations
  2. Implemented custom hooks for data fetching, filtering, and state management
  3. Split the monolithic component into smaller, focused components
  4. Applied container/presentation pattern with clear separation of concerns
  5. Added error handling, loading states, and improved UX

### Implementation Details

1. **API Client Enhancement**:
   - Created separate files for different API domains:
     - `/src/lib/api-client/users.js` - User operations
     - `/src/lib/api-client/roles.js` - Role operations
     - `/src/lib/api-client/utils.js` - Shared utilities
   - Implemented standardized error handling and response processing
   - Added caching and request deduplication to prevent duplicate API calls

2. **Custom Hooks Development**:
   - Created the following hooks:
     - `useUsers` - Manages user data and CRUD operations
     - `useRoles` - Handles role fetching and processing
     - `useUserFilter` - Provides filtering capabilities
     - `useUserForm` - Manages form state and validation
     - `useOrganizerActions` - Handles organizer-specific operations

3. **Component Structure**:
   - Implemented container/presentation pattern:
     - `UsersPageContainer` - Manages state and data fetching
     - `UsersPage` - Renders UI components
   - Created smaller, focused components:
     - `UserTable` - Displays user data with DataGrid
     - `UserSearchBar` - Provides search functionality
     - `UserTabNavigationBar` - Handles tab navigation
     - `AddUserDialog` - Dialog for creating users
     - `EditUserDialog` - Dialog for editing users

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Organized code into a clear structure:
     - `/components/users/hooks/` - Custom hooks
     - `/components/users/components/` - UI components
     - `/components/common/` - Shared components

5. **Error Handling and UX Improvements**:
   - Added loading states for better user feedback
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling
   - Enhanced search and filtering capabilities
   - Added optimistic updates for edit operations

# SNR after interactions
ðŸ”· S â€” Completed the Users Page refactoring by breaking down the monolithic component into smaller, focused components with clear separation of concerns. Implemented custom hooks for data management, standardized API client interfaces, and improved error handling and UX.

ðŸŸ¡ N â€” Next steps:
1. Apply the same refactoring patterns to other large pages (like Venues and Organizers)
2. Consider creating shared hooks for common functionality across pages
3. Implement comprehensive testing for the refactored components

ðŸŸ© R â€” The refactoring provides a blueprint for addressing similar issues in other parts of the application, particularly the Venues and Organizers pages which have similar complexity issues.
