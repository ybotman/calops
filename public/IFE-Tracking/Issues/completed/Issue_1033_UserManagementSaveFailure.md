**Last updated:** 2025-01-31 16:15

### Issues Identified:

**1. Missing onChange Prop (PRIMARY ISSUE):**
- `UserEditForm.js:53` expects `onChange` prop as required
- `EditUserDialog.js:41-46` only passes `user`, `roles`, `onSubmit`, `loading` 
- Missing `onChange` prop causes all field changes to fail
- Error logged at lines 82, 94, 122, 125 in UserEditForm.js

**2. DataGrid Pagination Warning (SECONDARY):**
- `UserTable.js:228` uses `rowCount` with `paginationMode="client"`
- MUI X warns this combination has no effect
- Should either remove `rowCount` or change to `paginationMode="server"`

**Root Cause:**
EditUserDialog component is missing the onChange prop implementation and passing

## üõ†Ô∏è PATCH (Required)
_Fix details, implementation notes, and blockers.  
Document what was changed, how, and any technical notes._  
**Last updated:** 2025-01-31 16:30

### Fixes Applied:

**1. PRIMARY FIX - Added onChange Prop to EditUserDialog:**
- Added `useState` and `useEffect` imports
- Created local state `editingUser` to track form changes
- Implemented `handleChange` function with nested field path support (e.g., 'localUserInfo.firstName')
- Added `onChange={handleChange}` prop to UserEditForm component
- Updated form submission to use local state

**2. SECONDARY FIX - Fixed DataGrid Pagination Warning:**
- Removed `rowCount` prop from DataGrid when using `paginationMode="client"`
- This eliminates MUI X warning about incompatible prop usage

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/users/components/EditUserDialog.js` - Added onChange prop handling
- `/src/components/users/components/UserTable.js` - Removed rowCount prop

**Technical Implementation:**
- onChange function handles nested object updates using dot notation paths
- State management ensures form changes are tracked locally before submission
- Maintains existing API compatibility
