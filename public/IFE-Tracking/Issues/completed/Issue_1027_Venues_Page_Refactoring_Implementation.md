# Issue 1027: Venues Page Refactoring Implementation

## Overview
This document details the implementation steps taken to refactor the Venues page, with a focus on fixing API endpoint issues, standardizing API client usage, and adding missing components.

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Endpoint Fix
- Corrected the API base URL in venues API client to properly use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BE_URL` or default to `http://localhost:3010`
- Fixed API response structure in venues/route.js to avoid double-nesting data in a data property

### 2. Component Implementation
- Created VenueTable component with full functionality for displaying venue data
- Added pagination support
- Implemented action buttons for edit, delete, and geo validation
- Enhanced display to include city, state, zip, and geolocation update timestamps
- Updated venues component index to export the VenueTable

### 3. API Client Standardization
- Modified useVenues hook to use the venuesApi client instead of direct axios calls
- Simplified response handling logic by leveraging the API client's consistent response format

### 4. Event Handlers
- Implemented proper handlers for all venue operations:
  - handleEditVenue
  - handleDeleteVenue
  - handleValidateGeo (with support for both single and batch validation)
  - handlePaginationChange

## Current Status
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint configuration
- ✅ Added VenueTable component with city, state, zip, and geo status information
- ✅ Standardized API client usage
- ✅ Implemented proper event handlers
- ✅ Added Import BTC Venues functionality with logging and validation
- ⏳ Need to test with real data
- ⏳ Consider adding VenueForm component for editing in a future update

## Technical Notes
- The venues page should now connect directly to port 3010 rather than 3003
- Response structure from API is now consistent
- Venues should be properly displayed with pagination and filtering

## Testing
The refactored venues page should be tested with the following scenarios:
1. Loading venues from the backend
2. Filtering venues by search term
3. Viewing by tab (All, Validated, Invalid Geo)
4. Pagination functionality
5. Editing, deleting, and validating venue operations
