# Issue 1041: Webpack Cache Error in Development

## Status: ðŸš§ In Progress

## Summary
Development server shows webpack cache errors when accessing the dashboard, specifically failing to stat cache pack files in the `.next/cache/webpack/server-development/` directory.

## Environment
- **Local Development**: DEVL branch
- **Next.js**: Development mode

## Error Details
```
[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/Users/tobybalsley/MyDocs/AppDev/MasterCalendar/calops/.next/cache/webpack/server-development/7.pack.gz'] {
  errno: -2,
  code: 'ENOENT',
  syscall: 'stat',
  path: '/Users/tobybalsley/MyDocs/AppDev/MasterCalendar/calops/.next/cache/webpack/server-development/7.pack.gz'
}
â¨¯ unhandledRejection: [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 
'/Users/tobybalsley/MyDocs/AppDev/MasterCalendar/calops/.next/cache/webpack/server-development/7.pack.gz']
<w> [webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 
'/Users/tobybalsley/MyDocs/AppDev/MasterCalendar/calops/.next/cache/webpack/server-development/0.pack.gz'
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm run dev` in local development
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3003/dashboard
3. Observe webpack cache errors in console

## Expected Behavior
Webpack should properly manage its cache files without ENOENT errors during development.

## Investigation Notes
- Errors appear to be related to webpack's PackFileCacheStrategy
- Multiple pack files (0.pack.gz, 7.pack.gz) are missing or cannot be accessed
- The application still compiles and runs, but these errors clutter the console
- May be related to Next.js cache management or file permissions

## Potential Solutions
1. Clear the .next cache directory and rebuild
2. Check file permissions on the cache directory
3. Update webpack configuration for development mode
4. Investigate if this is a known Next.js issue

## Next Steps
1. Try clearing .next cache: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
2. Verify file permissions on cache directory
3. Research similar issues in Next.js GitHub issues
4. Consider disabling webpack cache in development if issue persists
