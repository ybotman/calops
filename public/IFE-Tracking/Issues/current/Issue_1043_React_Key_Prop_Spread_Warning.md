# Issue 1043: React Key Prop Spread Warning in OrganizerConnectUserForm

## Status: ðŸš§ In Progress

## Summary
React warning appears when spreading props that contain a "key" prop into JSX in the OrganizerConnectUserForm component. React keys must be passed directly to JSX elements, not through spread operators.

## Environment
- **Local Development**: DEVL branch
- **Component**: OrganizerConnectUserForm
- **Location**: Autocomplete component usage (line 225)

## Error Details
```
OrganizerConnectUserForm.js:225 Warning: A props object containing a "key" prop is being spread into JSX:
  let props = {key: someKey, tabIndex: ..., role: ..., id: ..., onMouseMove: ..., onClick: ..., onTouchStart: ..., data-option-index: ..., aria-disabled: ..., 
aria-selected: ..., className: ..., children: ...};
  <li {...props} />
React keys must be passed directly to JSX without using spread:
  let props = {tabIndex: ..., role: ..., id: ..., onMouseMove: ..., onClick: ..., onTouchStart: ..., data-option-index: ..., aria-disabled: ..., aria-selected: 
..., className: ..., children: ...};
  <li key={someKey} {...props} />
    at Autocomplete
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the application in development mode
2. Navigate to a page with OrganizerConnectUserForm
3. Interact with the Autocomplete component
4. Open browser developer console
5. Observe the warning about key prop spreading

## Root Cause
The MUI Autocomplete component is internally spreading props that include the "key" prop. This violates React's requirement that keys must be passed directly to JSX elements.

## Expected Behavior
No warnings about key prop usage. All React keys should be passed directly to JSX elements.

## Investigation Notes
- Warning originates from MUI Autocomplete component's internal implementation
- The issue is at line 225 in OrganizerConnectUserForm.js
- This might be related to how the Autocomplete renderOption prop is implemented

## Potential Solutions
1. Check if custom renderOption is being used and extract key before spreading
2. Update to latest MUI version if this is a known issue
3. Implement a wrapper that properly handles the key prop
4. Review Autocomplete implementation for proper prop handling

## Next Steps
1. Review OrganizerConnectUserForm.js line 225 and surrounding code
2. Check if renderOption prop is customized
3. Test with latest MUI version
4. Implement fix to properly handle key prop
