# Issue 1044: Organizer Edit Save Not Working in Production

## Status: ‚úÖ Fixed

## Summary
Organizer edit functionality works correctly in DEVL environment but fails to save changes in PROD environment. This appears to be a synchronization issue between development and production deployments.

## Environment
- **DEVL**: Save functionality works correctly
- **PROD**: Save functionality fails
- **Component**: Organizer Edit Form

## Steps to Reproduce
1. In PROD environment (https://cal-ops.org), navigate to Organizers page
2. Click edit on any organizer
3. Make changes to organizer details
4. Click Save
5. Observe that changes are not persisted

## Expected Behavior
Changes made to organizer details should save successfully in production, matching the behavior in DEVL environment.

## Investigation Notes
- Feature/functionality works in DEVL but not in PROD
- Likely causes:
  - Code not properly synced between DEVL and PROD branches
  - Environment-specific configuration differences
  - API endpoint differences between environments
  - Permission/authentication issues in production
  - Missing database migrations or schema differences

- Recent organizer-related features and fixes

## Next Steps
1. Compare DEVL and PROD branches for organizer-related code differences
2. Check deployment logs for any failed deployments
3. Verify API endpoints are correctly configured in production
4. Test API calls directly to isolate frontend vs backend issues
5. Review recent merges to PROD branch
6. Check for any environment variable differences

## Root Cause Analysis

### üß≠ Scout Mode - 2025-01-06
Found the root cause! The `organizersApi.js` file has inconsistent backend URL configuration:

1. **getOrganizers()** hardcodes the TEST backend URL:
   ```javascript
   const backendUrl = 'https://calendarbe-test-bpg5caaqg5chbndu.eastus-01.azurewebsites.net';
   ```

2. **updateOrganizer()** uses environment variable:
   ```javascript
   const backendUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BE_URL || 'http://localhost:3010';
   ```

This causes a mismatch where:
- PROD fetches organizers from TEST backend (works)
- PROD tries to update organizers on wrong backend (fails)

### Solution
Update `getOrganizers()` to use the same environment variable pattern as other methods:
```javascript
const backendUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BE_URL || 'http://localhost:3010';
```

## Role Updates

### ü™û Mirror Mode - 2025-01-06
- Created issue documentation for organizer edit save failure in production
- Identified this as a potential environment synchronization issue

### üß≠ Scout Mode - 2025-01-06
- Investigated codebase and found root cause
- Identified hardcoded TEST backend URL in getOrganizers function
- Confirmed updateOrganizer uses different backend URL configuration
- Solution: Make backend URL configuration consistent across all methods

### üõ†Ô∏è Builder Mode - 2025-01-06
- Fixed hardcoded TEST backend URL in getOrganizers function
- Changed to use NEXT_PUBLIC_BE_URL environment variable
- Ensures consistency across all API methods
- Fix committed to issue/1044-organizer-edit-save-prod-sync branch
