# Issue 1042: React Hydration Warning in StatusPanel

## Status: ðŸš§ In Progress

## Summary
React hydration warning appears in the browser console indicating that a `<div>` cannot be a descendant of `<p>` in the StatusPanel component. This violates HTML semantics and causes hydration mismatches.

## Environment
- **Local Development**: DEVL branch
- **Component**: StatusPanel
- **Location**: MUI Typography component usage

## Error Details
```
app-index.js:33 Warning: In HTML, <div> cannot be a descendant of <p>.
This will cause a hydration error.

```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the application in development mode
2. Navigate to a page that renders StatusPanel
3. Open browser developer console
4. Observe hydration warning

## Root Cause
The warning occurs when a MUI Typography component with variant="body1" (which renders as `<p>`) contains a Box component (which renders as `<div>`). This violates HTML semantics where block-level elements cannot be nested inside paragraph elements.

## Expected Behavior
No hydration warnings should appear. All HTML should follow proper semantic structure.

## Investigation Notes
- Error stack trace points to MUI Typography and Box components
- The issue is in the StatusPanel component
- Need to identify where Typography components contain Box or other div elements

## Solution
Replace Typography components that contain block-level elements with appropriate alternatives:
1. Use Typography with `component="div"` prop
2. Use Box or Stack components instead of Typography for layout
3. Restructure the component to avoid nesting block elements in paragraphs

## Next Steps
1. Locate the problematic code in StatusPanel component
2. Identify all instances of Typography containing Box/div elements
3. Refactor to use proper HTML structure
4. Test to ensure no visual regression
